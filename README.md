## 🔧 How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashenud/currency-forecast.git
cd currency-forecast
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Add your API key**

This app uses a **free public API key** from [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com), stored in a `.env` file for simplicity.

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project:

```env
REACT_APP_EXCHANGE_API_KEY=your_free_public_key
```

> **Note:**
✅ This is a free, public key, so we’ve committed the .env file to the repository.
🔒 In a real production app, you should never commit secrets. Instead, move the key to a secure server/backend. 

4. **Run the app locally**

```bash
npm start
```
